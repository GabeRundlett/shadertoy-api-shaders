There might be better methods, but this is the one I\n\tchose. It's partly based off of IQ's \"Ellipse - Distance Estimation\" example.\n\n\tIf you press pause, you should notice that the contour lines are smooth and \n\tprecise, regardless of the shape of the curve.\n\t\n\tFor anyone wondering, the weird abstract image is just an amalgamation of two \n\tlayers of smooth 2D Voronoi and an old concentric circle trick. In pseudo code:\n\n\tfloat val = Vor(p*freq)*A1 + Vor(p*freq*3.)*A2;\n\tval = clamp(cos(val*freq2*PI)*contrast, 0., 1.);\n\n    See IQ's distance estimation example for a good explanation regarding the \n\tgradient related contour snippet:\n\n    Ellipse - Distance Estimation - https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MdfGWn\n    There's an accompanying articles, which is really insightful here:\n    https://iquilezles.org/articles/distance\n\n\tAnother example using the technique.\n\t2D Noise Contours - Shane\n\thttps://www.shadertoy.com/view/XdcGzB\n\n*/\n\n// Glossy version.

I'm not sure who came up with the original, but I think IQ\n// was behind this particular algorithm. It's just like the regular Voronoi\n// algorithm, but instead of determining the minimum distance, you accumulate\n// values - analogous to adding metaball field values. The result is a nice\n// smooth pattern.

Truchet patterns usually make use of one block, consisting\n\tof three strategically placed tori designed to intersect the centers of all cube faces.\n\n\tThis particular pattern introduces another variation that consists of two tori intersecting four \n\tfaces and a straight segment that runs through opposing faces. The resultant pattern has more of a \n\trandom pipework look -- as opposed to the standard snake-like one. By the way, you could save a \n    lot of extra decision making and use just the second tile, but I feel the pattern lacks a little\n\tvariance when doing that.\n\t\n\tAnyway, apart from some extra decision making and construction, the code doesn't differ too much \n\tfrom regular examples. By the way, I can thank Mattz for reminding me of a concept that I'd forgotten, \n\twhich helped me speed up the distance field equation. Without it, this example would run much slower.\n\tI've described it briefly somewhere in among the distance field setup.\n\n\tWhilst on the subject of optimization, I should probably mention that I often take shortcuts with\n\tthe distance field equations in order to save the GPU extra calculations. For instance, I'll use a \n\tbound, like \"max(max(x, y), z),\" for a cube instead of the correct - but usually more expensive - \n\tone. For the most part, you can get away with it, but things like shadows, etc, can be affected. \n\tIQ has an example that illustrates the point here:\n\n\tRotational symmetry - iq\n\thttps://www.shadertoy.com/view/XtSczV\n\n\t\n\tBased on:\n\n\t// Same concept, but with one tile, which makes it easier to comprehend.\n\tCubic Truchet Pattern - Shane\n\thttps://www.shadertoy.com/view/4lfcRl\n\n\tOther Truchet examples:\n\n\t// 3D Truchet flow.

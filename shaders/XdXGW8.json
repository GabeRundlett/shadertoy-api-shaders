When querying/requesting a noise value at\n// an arbitrary point in the plane, the grid cell in which the query is performed is\n// determined, the four vertices of the grid are determined and their random vectors\n// fetched. Then, the position of the current point under  evaluation relative to each\n// vertex is doted (projected) with that vertex' random vector, and the result is\n// bilinearly interpolated with a smooth interpolant.\n\n// All noise functions here:\n//\n// https://www.shadertoy.com/playlist/fXlXzf&from=0&num=12\n\n\n\nvec2 grad( ivec2 z )  // replace this anything that returns a random vector\n{\n    // 2D to 1D  (feel free to replace by some other)\n    int n = z.x+z.y*11111;\n\n    // Hugo Elias hash (feel free to replace by another one)\n    n = (n<<13)^n;\n    n = (n*(n*n*15731+789221)+1376312589)>>16;\n\n#if 0\n\n    // simple random vectors\n    return vec2(cos(float(n)),sin(float(n)));\n    \n#else\n\n    // Perlin style vectors\n    n &= 7;\n    vec2 gr = vec2(n&1,n>>1)*2.0-1.0;\n    return ( n>=6 ) ? vec2(0.0,gr.x) : \n           ( n>=4 ) ? vec2(gr.x,0.0) :\n                              gr;\n#endif                              \n}\n\nfloat noise( in vec2 p )\n{\n    ivec2 i = ivec2(floor( p ));\n     vec2 f =       fract( p );\n\t\n\tvec2 u = f*f*(3.0-2.0*f); // feel free to replace by a quintic smoothstep instead\n\n    return mix( mix( dot( grad( i+ivec2(0,0) ), f-vec2(0.0,0.0) ), \n                     dot( grad( i+ivec2(1,0) ), f-vec2(1.0,0.0) ), u.x),\n                mix( dot( grad( i+ivec2(0,1) ), f-vec2(0.0,1.0) ), \n                     dot( grad( i+ivec2(1,1) ), f-vec2(1.0,1.0) ), u.x), u.y);\n}\n\n// -----------------------------------------------\n\nvoid mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )\n{\n    vec2 p = fragCoord / iResolution.xy;\n\n\tvec2 uv = p*vec2(iResolution.x/iResolution.y,1.0) + iTime*0.25;\n\t\n\tfloat f = 0.0;\n\t\n    // left: noise\t\n\tif( p.x<0.6 )\n\t{\n\t\tf = noise( 32.0*uv );\n\t}\n    // right: fractal noise (4 octaves)\n    else\t\n\t{\n\t\tuv *= 8.0;\n        mat2 m = mat2( 1.6,  1.2, -1.2,  1.6 );\n\t\tf  = 0.5000*noise( uv ); uv = m*uv;\n\t\tf += 0.2500*noise( uv ); uv = m*uv;\n\t\tf += 0.1250*noise( uv ); uv = m*uv;\n\t\tf += 0.0625*noise( uv ); uv = m*uv;\n\t}\n\tf = 0.5 + 0.5*f;\n\t\n    f *= smoothstep( 0.0, 0.005, abs(p.x-0.6) );\t\n\t\n\tfragColor = vec4( f, f, f, 1.0 );\n}",

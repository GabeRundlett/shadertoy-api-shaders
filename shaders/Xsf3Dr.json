Seemingly\n// both look the same. However the hardware version (top) has discontinutities\n// that the software version (bottom) hasn't. These become apparent when \n// passing the color through a high frequency sin wave for example (rainbow\n// gradients) or when taking derivatives of the color (top most and bottom most\n// rows) - the hardware interpolation at the top produces a discrete series of\n// color jumps while the software interpolation produces a constant color\n// derivative as expected.\n//\n// You can undefine the USE8BIT in line 27 and confirm that indeed HW is \n// using 8 bit point arighmetic by checking line 46.\n//\n// More information: https://iquilezles.org/articles/hwinterpolation/\n\n\n//#define USE8BIT\n\nvoid mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )\n{\n\tvec2 p = fragCoord / iResolution.xy;\n\t\n\t// texture resolution\n\tfloat texRes = 64.0;\n\t\n\t// pixel under examination\n    ivec2 pixOff = ivec2(46,40);\n\t\n    // linear interpolation done by the hardware\t\n\tvec3 c = textureLod( iChannel0, (vec2(pixOff)+vec2(0.5+p.x,0.5))/texRes, 0.0 ).xyz;\n\n\t// linear interpolation made by hand\n\tvec3 d = mix( texelFetch( iChannel0, pixOff+ivec2(0,0), 0 ).xyz, \n\t\t\t\t  texelFetch( iChannel0, pixOff+ivec2(1,0), 0 ).xyz, \n#ifdef USE8BIT\n                  round(p.x*256.0)/256.0\t );\n#else\n\t\t\t\t  p.x );\n#endif\n\n\t// compare both. upper half: HW, lower half: manual\n\tvec3 r = (p.y<0.5) ? d : c;\n    \n    float h = abs(p.y-0.5);\n\n    // show derivatives\n\tif( h>0.3 ) r = 2.0*abs(dFdx(r))*iResolution.x;\n\n    // pass it through a high freq sin wave to highlight discontinuities\n    else if( h>0.15 ) r = 0.5+0.5*sin(r*314.0);\n\n\n    // separation bars\n\tr *= smoothstep( 0.004, 0.005, abs(p.y-0.5) );\n    r *= smoothstep( 0.001, 0.002, abs( abs(p.y-0.5)-0.15) );\n    r *= smoothstep( 0.001, 0.002, abs( abs(p.y-0.5)-0.30) );\n\t\n\tfragColor = vec4(r,1.0);\n}",

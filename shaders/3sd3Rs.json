This means no neighboring information is needed\n// in order to preserve continuity, and therefore it's much faster\n// than both Value and Gradient Noise.\n//\n// In fact, this is a hybrid between the two - it has zeros at\n// integer locations like Gradient noise, but the gradients/\n// derivatives are constant, +-1. That way each cycle's boundaries\n// are fixed and continuity is preserved always. Then, the single\n// per cycle random number K controls the value of the signal's\n// peak, a bit like in a Value Noise. A quartic function is used\n// to interpolate the whole curve inside the cycle.\n//\n// p(0)=0, p'(0)=1, p(1)=0, p'(1)=-1, p(1/2)=k, p'(1/2)=0\n//\n// results in\n//\n// p(x)=x·(x-1)·((16k-4)·x·(x-1)-1)\n//\n// The yellow curve shows this new Basic Noise, superimposed on\n// top of a regular Gradient Noise in dark grey.\n\nfloat hash( uint n );\n\n// Basic noise\nfloat bnoise( in float x )\n{\n    // setup    \n    float i = floor(x);\n    float f = fract(x);\n    float s = sign(fract(x/2.0)-0.5);\n    \n    // use some hash to create a random value k in [0..1] from i\n  //float k = hash(uint(i));\n  //float k = 0.5+0.5*sin(i);\n    float k = fract(i*.1731);\n\n    // quartic polynomial\n    return s*f*(f-1.0)*((16.0*k-4.0)*f*(f-1.0)-1.0);\n}\n\n// Traditional gradient noise\nfloat gnoise( in float p )\n{\n    uint  i = uint(floor(p));\n    float f = fract(p);\n\tfloat u = f*f*(3.0-2.0*f);\n\n    float g0 = hash(i+0u)*2.0-1.0;\n    float g1 = hash(i+1u)*2.0-1.0;\n    return 2.4*mix( g0*(f-0.0), g1*(f-1.0), u);\n}\n\n////////////////////////////////////\n\nfloat fbm( in float x )\n{    \n    float n = 0.0;\n    float s = 1.0;\n    for( int i=0; i<9; i++ )\n    {\n        n += s*bnoise(x);\n        s *= 0.5;\n        x *= 2.0;\n        x += 0.131;\n    }\n    return n;\n}\n\n\nvoid mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )\n{\t\n    float px = 1.0/iResolution.y;\n    vec2 p = fragCoord*px;\n\t\n    vec3 col = vec3( 0.0 );\n    col = mix( col, vec3(0.7), 1.0 - smoothstep( 0.0, 2.0*px, abs( p.y - 0.75 ) ) );\n    col = mix( col, vec3(0.7), 1.0 - smoothstep( 0.0, 2.0*px, abs( p.y - 0.25 ) ) );\n    p.x += iTime*0.1;\n    \n    {\n    float y = 0.75+0.25*gnoise( 6.0*p.x );\n    col = mix( col, vec3(0.3,0.3,0.3), 1.0 - smoothstep( 0.0, 4.0*px, abs(p.y-y) ) );\n    }\n\n    {\n    float y = 0.75+0.25*bnoise( 6.0*p.x );\n    col = mix( col, vec3(1.0,1.0,0.0), 1.0 - smoothstep( 0.0, 4.0*px, abs(p.y-y) ) );\n    }\n\n    {\n    float y = 0.25+0.15*fbm( 2.0*p.x );\n    col = mix( col, vec3(1.0,0.6,0.2), 1.0 - smoothstep( 0.0, 4.0*px, abs(p.y-y) ) );\n    }\n\n    fragColor = vec4( col, 1.0 );\n}\n\nfloat hash( uint n ) \n{   // integer hash copied from Hugo Elias\n\tn = (n<<13U)^n; \n    n = n*(n*n*15731U+789221U)+1376312589U;\n    return float(n&uvec3(0x0fffffffU))/float(0x0fffffff);\n}\n",

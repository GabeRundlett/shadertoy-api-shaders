Left is\n// direct use of cos(x), right is band-limited cos(x).\n//\n// Box-filtering of cos(x):\n//\n// (1/w)∫cos(t)dt with t ∈ (x-½w, x+½w)\n// = [sin(x+½w) - sin(x-½w)]/w\n// = cos(x)·sin(½w)/(½w)\n//\n// Can approximate smoothstep(2π,0,w) ≈ sin(w/2)/(w/2),\n// which you can also see as attenuating cos(x) when it \n// oscilates more than once per pixel.

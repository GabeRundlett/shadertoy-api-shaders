This illusion is pretty\n//  easy to explain. It's based on the \"afterimage\" idea like those inverted color flags\n//  and whatnot:\n//\n//      hhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterimage\n//\n//  The pink dots \"antagonize\" or \"tire out\" the red and blue receptors in your retina,\n//  leaving a green afterimage. In this animated example, as long as you stare steadily\n//  at the cross, the green dots mostly just cancel out the pink ones, except for the one\n//  moving missing one, where we see the green. With the movement disabled, the pink\n//  dots still disappear; the disappearing one just give us a chance to see the negative\n//  afterimage.\n//\n//  The title of the shader means \"This is not a green dot\" and is a reference to the\n//  1929 painting \"The Treachery of Images\" by Ren√© Magritte. Which seems like a good\n//  title to inspire the title of an optical illusion shader...while I also admit that\n//  my usage is far more literal and less meta than the original. I'm not a French \n//  speaker so please correct me if this is not right: I just used Google Translate.\n//\n//  I feel pretty good about the code golfing on this one, but I probably missed something\n//  and submissions in the comments are encouraged.\n// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n// Original by me: 279 chars\n//*\nvoid mainImage(out vec4 O, vec2 U)\n{\n    vec2 R = iResolution.xy,\n         u = (U - .5 * R) / R.y,\n         v = abs(u) / .01,                       // used to draw cross\n         a = atan(u.y, u.x) / 3.14 + vec2(1.06), // normalized angle\n         i = a - mod(a, .125);                   // angle index\n    \n    i.y -= .5; // generate sin in y component\n\n    O = vec4(v.x < 3. && v.y < .4 || v.y < 3. && v.x < .4 ? 0. : .7) + // draw cross\n            4.3 * vec4(1, -1, 1, 1) *                                  // dot color\n            max(0., .06                                                // size of dot\n                 - length(u + cos(i * 3.14) * .4)                      // distance to nearest dot\n                 - max(0., .2 - abs(mod(iTime * 2. + i.x, 2.))));      // turn off a rotating dot\n}\n/**/\n",

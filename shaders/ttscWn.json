I put it together a long time ago using the standard base code, \n    which you'll find in countless examples on the internet. I'm pretty sure \n    I started with IQ's \"Orbit Traps\" shader, which is a favorite amongst \n    many on here, then added a few extra lines to produce the effect you \n\tsee. There's not a lot to this at all, so hopefully, it'll be easy to \n    consume.\n\n    Producing Mandelbrot and Julia patterns is pretty straight forward. At \n    it's core, you're simply transforming each point on the screen in a \n    certain way many times over, then representing the transformed point \n    in the form of shades and colors.\n\n    In particular, you treat each point as if it were on a 2D complex plane, \n    then perform an iterative complex operation -- which, ironically, is not \n    complex at all. :) In this particular example, the iterative complex \n    derivative is recorded also, which is used for a bit of shading.\n\n    In regard to the shading process itself, most people tend to set a \n    bailout, then provide a color based on the transformed point distance,\n\tand leave it at that. However, with barely any extra code, it's \n    possible to makes things look more interesting.    \n\n    The patterns look pretty fancy, but they're nothing more than repeat \n    circles and grid boundaries applied after transforming the coordinates. \n    The shading and highlights were made up on the spot, but none of it was\n    complex, nor was it based on reality (no pun intended).\n\n\t\n\n    Related examples:\n\n    Based on one of IQ's really nice Mandelbrot example.

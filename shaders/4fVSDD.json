It'd probably take a while \n\tto walk from one end to the other. :)\n\n\tThe camera swings around a fair bit. I did that intentionally to show more of \n\tthe scene without distorting the lens and FOV too much.\n\n\tAdding detail to a scene is pretty straight forward - in concept anyway. Simply\n\tintegrate more objects. Trying to add detail without frying your GPU is another\n\tstory. Bump mapping the finer details definitely helped, but my slowest computer\n\tstruggled to maintain 45 FPS with this particular scene, which meant a lot of my\n\toriginal plans had to be abandoned.\n\n\tMost of this was pretty straight forward, but there's always one annoying aspect.\n\tFor me, believe it or not, it was the simple mesh looking floors. With such high\n\tfrequency repetition, Moire effects became a problem. The solution was to abandon\n\tthe distance field approach and fake it with a smooth bump mapped function.\n\n\tI try not to put too many conditional compiler options into shader code because\n\tit can make things confusing to read, but I added in a couple for variety. \n\tThere's an option to wrap the object around the camera, and an optional \"WARM\" \n\taesthetic by default.\n\n\n*/\n\n// Maximum ray distance.\n#define FAR 50. \n\n// Wrap the scene itself around the camera path.\n//#define OBJECT_CAMERA_WRAP \n\n// Warm setting.

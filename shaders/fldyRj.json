I actually have no idea what this looks like. :D\n    \n    Function warping is nothing new, and this particular example is just a \n    slightly dressed up version of Jolle and Jarble's previous work, which in \n    turn was very loosely based on one of Lomateron's recent examples -- The \n    respective links are below.\n    \n    Anyway, I've commented the code. However, there's definitely nothing \n    difficult to grasp here. The simple color imagery was produced in \n    \"Buffer A\", which was blended with previous frames for a bit of temporal \n    blurring. The result (Image tab) was then used to take two 3x3 blurred \n    samples in order to add some highlights.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Uses elements from the following shaders:\n    \n    Glass bubble lamp - Jarble: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ttcfD7\n    \n    Glass bubble lamp fork - Jolle: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WtdBDM\n    \n    Mount Mask - lomateron: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WdsfRf\n    \n    \n*/\n\n// Things look cleaner without highlights, and in some ways I prefer it.\n// However, it's less interesting... I think? :)\n#define HIGHLIGHTS\n\n// Serves no other purpose than to save having to write this out all the time. I'm using this \n// on a buffer texture, so no sRGB to linear operation needs to be performed. I'm also\n// using (and prefer to use) aspect correct pixel coordinates, so it's necessary to stretch \n// out the X values before retrieving them. It's also possible to stretch out the UV coordinates\n// first, then use a stretched sample spread, which is faster...

It can \n    also be referred to as a multiscale Truchet pattern. This particular \n    variation is pretty common, so there's a better than even chance that \n    you've seen some around. I put together a multiscaled Truchet example a \n    while ago, and this was one of many variations I tried out. I was saving it \n    for a pseudo 3D version, but have procrastinated on it for too long, so \n    figured I'd repackage the original and post it in 2D form.\n    \n    If it's not immediately obvious from the pattern, it's a simple rendering\n    of concentric-circle Truchet rings onto a randomly subdivided grid. \n    Uncommenting the \"SHOW_GRID\" define should make it more clear. When you\n    subdivide down a level, you simply render half the amount of concentric \n    rings in the next cell, and so forth. Common sense dictates that you should\n    choose an initial number of rings that can be halved to maintain integer \n    rings for the next subdivision; For instance, 12 rings in the big cells \n    will allow for 2 more sudivisions (12-6-3).\n    \n    This particular setup subdivides cells without considering neighbors, so \n    is shorter and easier to understand, but doesn't allow for rendering things \n    like long shadows, etc. There's a tiny bit of extra dressup code here, but \n    this is a pretty basic example with a reasonably small code footprint. A \n    simple black and white pattern would require far less code still... I'll \n    leave that as an exercise for the code golfing crowd. :)\n    \n    I would eventually like to produce a more 3D looking version. It's also \n    possible to produce these on other kinds of subdivision grids, like \n    triangles and others -- I have a triangle version floating around somewhere, \n    and a pattern mapped onto a 3D surface that I'd like to post later.\n    \n    \n    \n    Based on:\n    \n    A multiscale Truchet pattern that considers neighboring cells.\n    Quadtree Truchet - Shane\n    https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4t3BW4\n    \n    // A concentric circle Truchet pattern in under a tweet.

So this code iterates the\n// reference orbit Zn and also the current orbit Wn in delta form:\n//\n// Given\n//\n// Zn and Wn = Zn + ΔZn\n// \n// Then\n//\n// Zn+1 = f(Zn) = Zn² + C\n// Wn+1 = f(Wn) = f(Zn+ΔZn) = (Zn+ΔZn)² + C + ΔC = \n//              = Zn² + ΔZn² + 2·Zn·ΔZn + C+ΔC = \n//              = Zn+1 + ΔZn·(ΔZn + 2·Zn) + ΔC = \n//              = Zn+1 + ΔZn+1\n//\n// So, what we need to iterate is\n//\n// ΔZn+1 = (ΔZn² + ΔC) + 2·Zn·ΔZn  --> delta-orbit (Wn-Zn)\n//  Zn+1 = ( Zn² +  C)             --> periodic orbit, doesn't diverge\n\n\nvec2 cmul(vec2 a, vec2 b) { return vec2(a.x*b.x-a.y*b.y, a.x*b.y+a.y*b.x); }\n\n\nfloat mandelbrot_perturbation( vec2 c, vec2 dc )\n{\n    vec2 z  = vec2(0.0);\n    vec2 dz = vec2(0.0);\n    float n = -1.0;\n    for( int i=0; i<700; i++ )\n    {\n        dz = cmul(2.0*z+dz,dz) + dc;  // dz = cmul(dz,dz)+dc + 2.0*cmul(z,dz);\n        \n        z  = cmul(z,z)+c; // this could be precomputed since it's constant for the whole image\n        \n        // instead of checking for Wn to escape...\n        // if( dot(z+dz,z+dz)>4.0 ) { n=float(i); break; }\n        // ... we only check ΔZn, since Zn is periodic and can't escape\n        if( dot(dz,dz)>2. ) { n=float(i); break; }\n    }\n    return n;\n}\n\n\nvoid mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )\n{\n    // input\n    vec3 col = vec3(0.0);\n        vec2  p = 3.0*(2.0*fragCoord-iResolution.xy)/iResolution.y;\n    \n        // viewport\n        float zoom; vec2 c;\n        //zoom=0.001 + 0.001*-0.999; c=vec2(-0.7436441,0.131825);\n       zoom=1./exp2(mod(iTime, 30.)); c=vec2(-0.743641,0.131825);\n\n        // mandelbrot\t\n        vec2 dc = p*zoom;\n        float l =  mandelbrot_perturbation(c, dc);\n        // color\n        col += (l<0.0) ? vec3(0.0) : 0.5 + 0.5*cos( pow(zoom,0.2)*l*0.5 + vec3(sin(iTime)+1.5,3.,2.0));\n\n    \n    // output    \n    fragColor = vec4(col,1.0);\n}",

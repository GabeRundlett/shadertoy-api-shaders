To do this the code\n// subtracts the top-left Y-coordinate from the height of the canvas.\n// But for 800x450 canvas, the topmost line is line number 449 and not 450,\n// as the first line at the bottom is line number 0.\n//\nvec2 R;\nvec4 mains(vec2 U) {\n    if(any(equal(ivec2(iMouse.xy),ivec2(U))) && distance(iMouse.xy+0.5,U) > 3.0) {\n        return vec4(1);\n    }\n    float pat = floor(mod(U.x+U.y+iTime*8.,16.0)/8.);\n    return any(equal(ivec4(U.xyxy),ivec4(0,0,R-1.))) ? vec4(0,pat,0,1) : vec4(0,0,pat,1);\n}\nvoid mainImage(out vec4 O, vec2 U) {R=iResolution.xy;O=mains(U);}",

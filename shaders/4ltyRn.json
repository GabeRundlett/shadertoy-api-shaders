At the time, I \n\talso considered making a 2D simplex weave, but got sidetracked -- probably \n\tby another of Mattz's interesting examples. :) Anyway, I finally got around\n\tto it. \n\n\tA hexagonal weave arrangement has more variation, but I think the triangular \n\tversion has a certain tightly wound appeal. I tried to track down an example \n\timage on the internet to reference, but couldn't find one, so didn't know\n\twhat the pattern would look like until I'd coded it. \n\n\tThankfully, the construction process was pretty simple: First, set up a 2D \n\tsimplex grid -- the equilateral triangle one. For each grid (triangle) cell, \n\trender a torus at each of the vertices. Make sure the center of the ring of \n\teach toroidal segment cuts the midpoint of each of the triangle edge lines. \n\tThe magic happens when you render the three tori in random order, which\n\tresults in the spaghetti-like pattern you see.\n\n\tHow one sets about randomizing the rendering order depends upon the preferred \n\ttechnique of the individual, but I've explained how I went about it in the \n\tcode. On a side note, most of the code in this example is window dressing. \n\tThe pattern portion isn't long at all. I might put together a minimal version\n\tto illustrate that... or wait for Fabrice or Greg Rostami o do it. :)\n\n\tI coded this for a bit of fun, but it's possible to apply the pattern to far \n\tmore interesting things. For instance, it can be applied to anthing that's\n\tconstructed with equilateral triangles -- like an icosahedral surface, etc. \n\n\tOn the 3D side, I've already rendered some prisms in a simplex arrangement, \n\tbut I'd like to put together an extruded version of this particular random \n\tpattern at some stage... I'm not looking forward to it, so I hope it looks \n\tinteresting when completed. :)\n\n\tBy the way, there's a \"NO_WEAVE\" option below that is mildy interesting. \n\tPlus, a \"SHOW_SIMPLEX_GRID\" option for anyone who requires a rough visual \n\tcell tile construction aid.\n\n\n\n\tSimilar examples:\n\n\t// A triangular Truchet pattern.

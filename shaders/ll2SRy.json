However, it attempts to give that feel whilst maintaining \n\tframerate. I've tried to keep things simple and keep the code to a minimum. It needs \n\tsome God rays, but that'd just add to the complexity.\n\n\tThe inspiration to do this came from a discussion with Fabrice Neyret, after viewing\n\this various cube examples. He's a pretty clever guy, so he'll probably know how to do \n\tthis ten times faster with ten times more efficiency. :)\n\n\tIt doesn't look much like it, but Duke's port of Las's \"Cloudy Spikeball\" also provided \n\tinspiration.\n\n\tBy the way, I deliberately made it blurry, and added more jitter than necessary in the\n\tpursuit of demo art. :) However, you can tweak the figures and dull down the jitter\tto \n\tproduce a reasonably clean looking, transparent scene... of vacuum filled objects. :)\n\n\t// Related shaders:\n\n\tCrowded Cubes 2 - FabriceNeyret2\n\thttps://www.shadertoy.com/view/ltBSRy\n\n\tCloudy Spikeball - Duke\n    https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MljXDw\n    // Port from a demo by Las - Worth watching.\n    // http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=56866\n    // http://www.pouet.net/topic.php?which=7920&page=29&x=14&y=9\n\n    // Here's a more interesting, cleaner version.\n    Transparent Lattice - Shane\n    https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Xd3SDs\n\t\n*/\n\n\n// Cheap vec3 to vec3 hash.

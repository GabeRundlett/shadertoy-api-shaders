For all serious\nshaders (including compact/'golf' code), please use the standard function\ndefinition.\n\nAs of 2020-11-07, the shader main function, where mainImage is invoked, has\nbeen moved to the header code prepended to shaders, so the '#define mainImage'\ntrick no longer works.\n\n - Theron Tarigo (ttg)\n   Updated 2020-11-07\n\n*/",

BigWIngs has already produced one (link below), so this is just my\n\ttake on it. This particular example was written from scratch, and is based on some old \n\tcode of mine, but the concept is essentially the same.\n\n\tI put in a few additions, and partly addressed BigWIngs's UV coordinate mapping concerns. \n\tThe little portal lights are rendered using UV coordinates,\twhich work for the wrappable \n\tdot pattern I chose, but I wouldn't say it's a robust solution. However, it would be with a \n\tlittle extra work.\n\n\tConsidering the time of year, I put in a half hearted attempt to give it a mild Christmas \n\tfeel - Redish background, green Christmas lights... It's a very abstract representation. :) \n\tI find green and red a challenging combination to work with, but I think I got away with it.  \n\t\n\tAlgorithmically speaking, constructing one of these patterns is not difficult: Instead of \n\tusing just the standard triple-arc hexagonal Truchet tile, you mix in other combinations,\n\tsuch as overlapping arcs, straight lines, etc. Uncomment the \"SHOW_GRID\" directive, and you \n\tshould be able to make out a few. Some of the tile combinations involve arcs and lines that \n\tcross over one another, which gives the weave effect. Elements that cross over necessitate \n\ta rendering order requirement, but that's not particularly difficult to implement.\n\n\tThe pattern is rendered in a pseudo-3D vector-graphics style. The cool thing about 2D \n\tdistance field values is that you can use them to produce some simple -- but effective -- \n\toldschool Photoshop effects: Layers, drop shadows, highlights, bevels, edging, etc. All are \n\tvery cheap, and a lot of the time, just involve an extra \"mix\" and \"smoothstep\" combination, \n\tand sometimes, an extra distance function call. This example was produced using these \n\tsimple methods.\n\n\tRelated references:\n\t\n\t// The original: Much less code, so if you're trying to get a handle on how to make\n\t// a random hexagonal weave pattern, this is the one you should be looking at.\n\tBigWIngs - Hexagonal Truchet Weaving \n\thttps://www.shadertoy.com/view/llByzz\n\n\n*/\n\n//#define SHOW_GRID\n//#define MULTICOLORED_LIGHTS\n\n// Standard 2D rotation formula.\nmat2 r2(in float a){ float c = cos(a), s = sin(a); return mat2(c, -s, s, c); }\n\n// Helper vector.

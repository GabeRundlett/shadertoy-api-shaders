# Shadertoy Shader Backup

This repo is a back-up of all the shaders made public through the Shadertoy API
The download was done on October 5th, 2024.

## Why?

I downloaded all these shaders because I wanted to test as many shaders as possible in my [desktop-shadertoy](https://github.com/GabeRundlett/desktop-shadertoy) application.

## What is "shader-list.json"?
`shader-list.json` is the result of the ShaderToy API query to get all the public shader IDs in the database. Note: The count of shaders in the list is greater than the number of shaders in the `shaders` folder, and I believe that's because some of the IDs overlap with different casing, however I am using Windows and can't store 2 files with the "same name" even though they have different casing.

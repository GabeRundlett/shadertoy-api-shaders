# Shadertoy Shader Backup

This repo is a back-up of all the shaders made public through the Shadertoy API
The download was done on October 5th, 2024.

## Why?

I downloaded all these shaders because I wanted to test as many shaders as possible in my [desktop-shadertoy](https://github.com/GabeRundlett/desktop-shadertoy) application.
